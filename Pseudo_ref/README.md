I'm using one sample's pooled reads to create a pseudo reference against *Elaeis guineensis*'s whole genome. The purpose is to:

**1)** Manage to get something assembled.  
**2)** Use the assembled pseudoreference as a closer reference to my species for future analyses.

*Caveats:* The effective ploidy of the sample (2n*individuals)
